## 🚀 How to Compile and Run Assignments

  **🔹For C files**

  ▪ To compile and run any .c file :

    gcc filename.c -o output
  
     ./output

  **🔹For C++ files**

  ▪ To compile and run any .cpp file :

    g++ filename.cpp -o output
   
     ./output

   **🔹For Java files**
   
  ▪ To compile and run any .java file :

    javac filename.java
    
    java filename

**🛠 Setup Checklist**

Ensure the following are installed and configured:

  ● GCC for C
  
  ● G++ for C++
  
  ● Java JDK for Java
  
  ● Use the cd command to navigate into the folder containing your assignment.
  
  ● Each file runs independently—no need for external dependencies or input files.
